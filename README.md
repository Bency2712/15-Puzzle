#  The Game of Fifteen, is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The puzzle is arranged in a 4x4 grid, making a total of 15 tiles. The objective of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles by sliding them into the empty space to achieve a particular ordering, often starting from an initial state where the tiles are scrambled randomly.
